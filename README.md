Crawfish is a python library for pcohp analysis on JDFTx calculations. 

## About `crawfish`

Crawfish (originally called ultraSoftCrawfish) is a python library intended primarily for performing bonding analysis on the output of JDFTx calculations. Its reason for existing (as alluded to in the original name) is that the state-of-the-art COHP analysis software (LOBSTER) only supports calculations with PAW pseudopotentials. While the researchers of LOBSTER have shown unavoidable pitfalls when attempting cohp analysis on non-PAW calculations, cohp analysis on calculations of other pseudopotential-type calculations still has its place in computational chemistry. 

## Why and when should I use `crawfish`?
